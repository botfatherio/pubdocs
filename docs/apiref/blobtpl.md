The BlobTpl is used to describe the shape and size of blobs. Such blobs can then be found on screenshots using the [Vision API](../vision)s `.findBlobs` method.

If you want to look for blobs of a certain color, isolate that color on your [Image](../image) in beforehand. To do you used the [Image](../image) types `.isolateColorRange` method. After doing so only blobs of the desired color are left.

## BlobTpl methods

_TODO_ ...there are getters and setter for all parameters mentioned in the _Creating a BlobTpl_ section.
